# ROI Measurement Frameworks for Enterprise AI

## Key Insight
Most AI ROI frameworks fail because they measure the wrong things. Effective frameworks must capture both direct cost savings and indirect value creation, while accounting for the total cost of AI ownership.

## Framework: The AI Value Stack

### Layer 1: Direct Cost Reduction
- Labor hours automated (easiest to measure)
- Error rate reduction (quality improvements)
- Processing speed improvements
- Example: Document processing — 80% cost reduction, 95% accuracy improvement

### Layer 2: Revenue Enhancement
- Faster time-to-decision
- Improved customer experience metrics
- New product capabilities enabled by AI
- Harder to attribute directly to AI investment

### Layer 3: Strategic Optionality
- Organizational capability building
- Data asset creation
- Competitive positioning
- Most valuable but hardest to quantify

## Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
Critical to include:
- [[gpu-cloud-lock-in|Infrastructure costs]] (often 40-60% of total)
- [[inference-cost-curves|Ongoing inference costs]] (declining but significant)
- Integration and maintenance (often underestimated by 3x)
- [[change-management-ai|Change management and training]]
- Monitoring, security, and compliance

## Common Mistakes
1. **Measuring pilot ROI, not production ROI** — [[pilot-to-production-gap|pilot economics are misleading]]
2. **Ignoring opportunity cost** — what else could the team have built?
3. **Snapshot vs trajectory** — AI systems improve over time; one-time measurement misses this
4. **Denominator errors** — comparing AI cost to full FTE cost (humans do more than one task)

## Practical Guidance
- Start measuring ROI at pilot inception, not completion
- Use A/B testing where possible (AI-assisted vs baseline)
- Report on leading indicators (adoption rate, query volume) alongside lagging indicators (cost savings)
- Re-measure quarterly as [[inference-cost-curves|costs decline]] and models improve

## For Investors
Strong ROI frameworks are a [[founder-market-fit-signals|founder-market fit signal]]. Startups that help enterprises measure AI ROI have a meta-opportunity — they solve the measurement problem that blocks [[seed-to-series-a-bridge|Series A metrics]] for other AI companies.
