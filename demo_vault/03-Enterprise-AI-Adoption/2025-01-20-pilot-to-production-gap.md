# The Pilot-to-Production Gap

## Key Insight
85% of enterprise AI pilots never reach production deployment. The primary barriers are not technical — they are organizational, economic, and architectural. Companies that solve the "last mile" of AI deployment will capture enormous value.

## Root Causes

### 1. Integration Complexity (40% of failures)
- AI pilots run in isolation; production requires integration with existing systems
- Data pipelines that work for demos break at enterprise scale
- [[model-serving-architectures|Serving architecture]] decisions made in pilot phase don't survive production requirements

### 2. ROI Ambiguity (30% of failures)
- Pilots demonstrate "cool demos" but lack clear [[roi-measurement-frameworks|ROI metrics]]
- CFOs require quantified business impact before production investment
- The gap between "AI works" and "AI generates measurable value" kills projects

### 3. Organizational Resistance (20% of failures)
- [[change-management-ai|Change management]] is underestimated or ignored
- Middle management sees AI as a threat rather than a tool
- No clear ownership of AI initiatives across IT, business units, and data teams

### 4. Infrastructure Misalignment (10% of failures)
- Pilot infrastructure (notebooks, single-GPU) doesn't translate to production
- [[gpu-cloud-lock-in|Cloud commitments]] made for pilot don't scale economically
- Security, compliance, and monitoring requirements add 3-6 months of work

## What Successful Companies Do Differently
1. **Start with production architecture** — even for pilots
2. **Define ROI metrics before the pilot begins** — not after
3. **Assign executive sponsorship** — not just technical leads
4. **Budget for integration** — 60% of total project cost, not 20%

## Investor Signal
For VCs evaluating AI startups: [[founder-market-fit-signals|founders who understand]] the pilot-to-production gap build more defensible businesses. Companies with multiple production deployments (not just pilots) command [[power-law-returns|premium valuations]].
