# Seed-to-Series A Bridge: Navigating the Gap

## Key Insight
The "Series A gap" has widened in 2024-2025, with only 25% of seed-funded AI startups raising Series A (down from 35% in 2021). Bridge rounds have become a standard — not exceptional — part of the fundraising path.

## Current Dynamics
- Average time from seed to Series A: 24 months (up from 18 months)
- 60% of companies that eventually raise A do a bridge/extension first
- Median bridge round: $2-4M on SAFEs or convertible notes
- Bridge-to-A conversion rate: ~45%

## When Bridges Work
Bridge rounds are constructive when:
1. The company has clear product-market fit signals but needs 6-9 months more data
2. [[roi-measurement-frameworks|Enterprise ROI metrics]] are promising but sample size is small
3. The founding team demonstrates [[founder-market-fit-signals|strong founder-market fit]] signals
4. Existing investors have conviction and lead the bridge

## When Bridges Fail
Red flags for bridge rounds:
- No measurable progress since seed (the "bridge to nowhere")
- Existing investors declining to participate
- Raising bridge to "figure out" product-market fit (too late)
- [[pilot-to-production-gap|Stuck in pilot purgatory]] with enterprise customers

## Structural Considerations
- SAFEs with caps create valuation continuity to Series A
- Bridge notes with excessive discounts signal investor uncertainty
- Pro-rata rights in bridge rounds matter for [[power-law-returns|power law portfolio construction]]

## AI-Specific Pattern
AI startups face unique bridge dynamics:
- Infrastructure costs ([[gpu-cloud-lock-in|GPU spending]]) consume runway faster
- [[inference-cost-curves|Declining inference costs]] can improve unit economics during bridge period
- Enterprise sales cycles for AI products extend the path to Series A metrics
