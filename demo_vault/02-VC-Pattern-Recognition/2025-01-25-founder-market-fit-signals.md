# Founder-Market Fit Signals in the AI Era

## Key Insight
Traditional founder-market fit signals (domain expertise, network, prior exits) remain necessary but insufficient for AI companies. A new set of signals — "technical taste," data intuition, and infrastructure fluency — are emerging as stronger predictors.

## New Signal Framework

### Tier 1: Technical Taste
- Can the founder articulate _why_ they chose specific model architectures?
- Do they understand the trade-offs between fine-tuning vs RAG vs prompt engineering?
- Have they built systems that handle AI failure modes gracefully?

### Tier 2: Data Intuition
- Do they have a proprietary data acquisition strategy?
- Can they explain their data flywheel — how usage improves the product?
- Understanding of [[inference-cost-curves|inference economics]] as a competitive lever

### Tier 3: Infrastructure Fluency
- Awareness of [[gpu-cloud-lock-in|infrastructure lock-in risks]]
- Ability to make build-vs-buy decisions on [[model-serving-architectures|serving infrastructure]]
- Understanding of scaling dynamics from prototype to production

## Anti-Signals
- "We'll just use GPT-4 for everything" (no technical depth)
- No plan for data moat or proprietary advantage
- Underestimating [[change-management-ai|enterprise change management]] complexity
- Ignoring [[pilot-to-production-gap|the pilot-to-production gap]]

## Predictive Value
In analyzing 50 AI-native seed investments from 2022-2023:
- Founders scoring high on all three tiers: 4x more likely to reach Series A
- Technical taste alone was the strongest single predictor (2.3x lift)
- This reinforces [[power-law-returns|power law dynamics]] — better founder selection concentrates returns

## Process Implication
Evaluating these signals requires technical depth in the investor. Generalist VCs may struggle to assess AI-specific [[seed-to-series-a-bridge|founder quality]] without technical partners.
