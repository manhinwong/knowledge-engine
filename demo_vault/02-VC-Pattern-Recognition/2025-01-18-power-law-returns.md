# Power Law Returns: The Math Hasn't Changed

## Key Insight
Analysis of 2024 exit data confirms the enduring power law: the top 5% of investments generate 60-70% of total fund returns. What has changed is the _time to outlier_ — AI-native companies are reaching escape velocity faster.

## Updated Data (2024 Vintage)
- Top 1% of deals: 40x+ returns (drove 35% of total fund value)
- Top 5% of deals: 10x+ returns (drove 65% of total fund value)
- Median deal: 1.2x return
- 40% of deals returned less than 1x

## Implications for Portfolio Construction
The power law demands a specific portfolio strategy:
1. **Size matters less than access** — getting into the right deals matters more than ownership percentage
2. **Follow-on reserves are critical** — the ability to double down on winners compounds returns
3. **Loss ratio is misleading** — a 50% loss rate is acceptable if winners are 50x+

## AI Acceleration Effect
AI-native startups are compressing the timeline from seed to outlier status:
- Traditional SaaS: 7-10 years to $100M ARR
- AI-native: 3-5 years to equivalent value creation
- This connects to [[founder-market-fit-signals]] — identifying AI-native founders early is increasingly valuable

## Connection to Infrastructure
Companies building on [[gpu-cloud-lock-in|GPU infrastructure moats]] or [[model-serving-architectures|novel serving architectures]] show characteristics of potential outliers — deep technical moats with expanding TAM.

## Open Question
Does the power law concentrate further in AI? If AI enables winner-take-most dynamics, the top 1% may drive even more of fund returns, making [[seed-to-series-a-bridge|early-stage access]] even more critical.
